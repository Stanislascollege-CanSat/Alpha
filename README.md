# Alpha: Software
#### This application will be used as Mission Control software for the Baby Cans. It is mainly built using Processing 3.4.
This software will be used for the Dutch CanSat competition.

- Application status: being developed.

### The applicaiton has been completely revisioned!

- The design is now ready to accept more than 4 to 6 views and the layout of the views has changed.
- You can now scroll between the views using the LEFT and RIGHT arrows on your keyboard.
- A dashboardView is included, which will always stay visible and contains elements like a console.
- Full resolution support is now implemented.
- Anti-aliasing level 8/8 has been applied.

- The programmer doesn't have to worry about the position or the rotation of any View that he or she wants to display in the program. The viewManager is now responsible for that as well.
